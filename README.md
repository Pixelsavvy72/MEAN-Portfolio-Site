# MEAN Portfolio App

I am creating this for my nephew's photography site (note: The images here aren't his except in the title bar. Those in the body are just placeholders).<br> 
Though similar to my other portfolio app, this one is MEAN stack and uses Angular single page technology with two-way data binding. Once logged in, a user or users can create new images and edit existing images through a simple form. Details such as image title and description, as well as the order on the page can all be controlled from within each individual image's form. Selecting a category on the top instantly displays the images within that category without the need to change or reload pages.

Functionality
- Angular single page application
- Mobile first design
- RESTful routes
- User defined ordering of projects on homepage
- Login / logout
- Authentication and authorization
- Full CRUD operations
